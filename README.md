# MovieCorn üçøReact App

This repository houses the **MovieCorn React App**, a project designed and developed by Sajal Timilsina. MovieCorn utilizes **React** for its frontend architecture to create an interactive movie browsing and tracking platform.

## Introduction

MovieCorn is a single-page application (SPA) built using **React** and various custom hooks to access and display movie data fetched from the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). It allows users to search for movies, view details, rate them, and maintain a personal watch list.
